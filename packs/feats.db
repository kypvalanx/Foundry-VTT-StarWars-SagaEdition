It seems that you can't make any existing Starships using these rules and starting with a Stock Starship. Am I doing something wrong? </p><p><b>A:</b> Probably not. A vast number of individual Starships have been created over the last few decades since <i>A New Hope</i> came out, and at no point was there a cohesive Starship design system to guide authors of fiction or gaming products. As such, it is effectively impossible to reverse-engineer a design system that covers all these varied examples- or, at least, any such system would be so complex that it wouldn't be easy to use in a game. </p><p>Given that, we designed the system from the point of the typical hero who might be interested in modifying an existing Starship or scratch-building a new one. This hero doesn't have the benefit of vast numbers of the best engineers and test pilots in the galaxy (like at the Corellian Engineering Corporation), nor does this hero have an entire star system dedicated to the building of city-sized Starships with mass-production facilities to match (like at Kuat Drive Yards). </p><p>This hero, instead, is relegated to building \"A typical new Starship from a typical production facility,\" as noted at the bottom of Table 3–8: <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stock_Ship_Types\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stock Ship Types\">Stock Ship Types</a>. The Stock Starships are designed to reflect that, making it possible to make something decent and functional, but not something that would easily outshine the big name starships. </p><p>For example, a hero could build a decent light freighter, something comparable to a <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/YT-1300\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"YT-1300\">YT-1300</a> in stats and price. </p><p>The biggest difference? The <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/YT-1300\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"YT-1300\">YT-1300</a> would have a lot of extra <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emplacement_Points\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Emplacement Points\">Emplacement Points</a> left over- and that's precisely what the Corellian Engineering Corporation is known for. Think about it: if any yahoo on a backwater planet could build a freighter that's just as good, why would the YT-series freighters sell so well throughout the galaxy? </p><p>Since most heroes won't ever control a galaxy-spanning corporate giant and be able to use these resources, it seems a little silly to spend page space exploring the ins and outs of galactic-scale mass production. Similarly, we might give broad outlines of supply and demand by listing a planet's major exports and imports, but we won't be creating rules that account for macroeconomic cycles, unemployment, inflation, and so forth. (Let's face it: Most of us are just here to shoot Stormtroopers.) </p><p>Now, if you as the GM want to build Starships beyond what the <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stock_Starships\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stock Starships\">Stock Starships</a> can manage, there's really not a reason for you to hamstring yourself with those rules: just write up stats that seem like a good challenge for your players, using similar Starships as benchmarks for things like price, appropriate game statistics for that type of ship, and so forth. </p><p>And if you and your players really want more comprehensive rules that go beyond those in the book, by all means do so! You might look at <a href=\"https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gear_Templates\" title=\"Gear Templates\">Gear Templates</a> to get some inspiration for coming up with appropriate special benefits and restrictions for different manufacturers. </p><p>Alternatively, you might allow manufacturers to come up with \"Proprietary\" Stock Starships that are better than the typical ones listed in the book. For example, Kuat Drive Yards might have a really good \"Stock Star Destroyer\" and Corellian Engineering Corporation might have an outstanding \"Stock YT-Series,\" and they use these as the baseline for producing several similar Starship designs. </p><p><b>Q:</b> When building a new design from a Stock Starship, can you remove or replace existing systems that come with the stock ship? For example, could I take those high-performance engines off a stock interceptor and use the cash to buy other systems? </p><p><b>A:</b> You can, but it's not very efficient. You get only 1/4 the listed value of any system you remove from a Starship, even a Stock Starship. </p><p>Stock Starships usually get their starting systems at a substantial discount because they are so well integrated into the baseline design. Removing them requires a lot of inefficient workarounds, resulting in a lower price comparable to selling a used Starship component. </p>","textDescription":"","sourceString":"","attributes":{},"choices":[],"modes":[],"providedItems":{},"payload":"","buildInstructions":[],"prerequisite":{"children":[{"text":"Tech Specialist feat","requirement":"Tech Specialist","type":"FEAT"},{"text":"Trained in Mechanics","requirement":"Mechanics","type":"TRAINED SKILL"}],"text":"Tech Specialist feat, and Trained in Mechanics","type":"AND"},"categories":[{"value":"Technician Bonus Feats"},{"value":"Feats"}],"supplier":{},"possibleProviders":["Technician Bonus Feats","General Feats"],"isSupplied":false},"name":"Starship Designer","flags":{},"type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","_stats":{"systemId":"swse","systemVersion":"0.6.30","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1680203886945,"modifiedTime":1680203888099,"lastModifiedBy":"tih8Q1fJUuDFWVCX"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"tih8Q1fJUuDFWVCX":3},"_id":"0HFtZUZvI7tGR4zl"}
